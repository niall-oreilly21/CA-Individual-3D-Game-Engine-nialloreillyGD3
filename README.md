## Rules of the Game
+ The main objective of the game is to keep eating as much food as possible to increase your score.

+ Each time the player eats an apple(**Spheres**) the length of the player's snake grows by one. The snakes also become faster.

+ This game is not exactly the same as the traditional Snake game. There is enemy poison(**Tetrahedrons**) obstacles that appear in the game from level 2 onwards. If the player hits them then they will lose.

+ When the player goes out of the bounds of the world the snake's head will appear from the exact position on the other side of the cube.

## Camera
+ One of the main features of the game is the camera. Since the game is in 3D the player should use all six cameras to get a better view of where the snake is.
